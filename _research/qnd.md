To understand the Earth’s changing climate, it is important to estimate how much heat the ocean takes up from the atmosphere and how the ocean recirculates the heat around the globe. Directly obtaining these estimates from measurements is complicated because oceanographers cannot measure the ocean everywhere and at all times. Ocean measurements taken from ships or freely drifting instruments are expensive and difficult to obtain, especially in regions with ice cover or rough weather conditions. Given the high cost and logistical challenges of ocean instrument deployment, ocean observing systems have to be designed carefully. Key questions are: What information is contained in already existing observation networks? Is there any redundancy in current configurations? What do existing systems, such as the Atlantic mooring arrays, tell us about hydrographic and circulation quantities in remote oceanic regions with few observations?

To tackle these questions, our group performs quantitative network design, through a combination of adjoint modeling, Bayesian inverse methods, and Hessian uncertainty quantification. By means of these computational tools, quantitative network design suggests an optimal observing strategy and supports effective instrument placements in the future.
