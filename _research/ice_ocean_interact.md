The Antarctic ice sheet gains and loses mass respectively via snowfall and
gravity driven ice streams which flow from land to the sea.
Ice shelves form where these streams reach the sea, floating over the ocean due
to the density difference between ice and seawater.
These formations are critical to the climate system since, via lateral
buttressing, they hold back continental land ice which can contribute to sea
level rise when melted or discharged into the ocean.
Ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) region of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet have some of the highest melt rates in Antarctica, as they are susceptible
to relatively warm ocean currents at depth, and hold back enough
ice to raise global sea levels by an estimated 1.2m.
However, it is difficult and expensive to observe the behavior of these ice
shelves because the ASE is remote and hostile to human activity.
It is therefore common to infer the relationship between nearby oceanic
conditions and ice shelf melting qualitatively from sparse observations.

Our research group is focused on quantifying the degree to which the ocean
circulation influences melt rates, through the use of the adjoint capabilities
of the [MITgcm](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Additionally, we perform Bayesian calibration of key parameters and
quantities which influence the ice-ocean interactions, such that our models of
sub-iceshelf circulation fit observations and follow the governing theory of the
gcm.
This allows us to quantify the degree to which these sparse and difficult to
obtain observations constrain our underlying model, and suggest an optimal
observing strategy.
