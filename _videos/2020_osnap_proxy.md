OSNAP is an international program designed to provide a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the subpolar North Atlantic. Helen Pillar and Nora Loose look at two important questions: What dynamical information is sequestered within OSNAP time series? How can this information be leveraged for constraining important remote quantities?
