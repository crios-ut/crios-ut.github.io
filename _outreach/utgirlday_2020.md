CRIOS members Nora Loose, Helen Pillar and An T. Nguyen, and Tim Smith participated in 2020â€™s #UTGirlDay, which took place on February 22. The group showed 500 elementary and middle school kids and their parents how to conduct simple yet powerful experiments to understand the role of sea ice and glacial melts in the changing Arctic climate and and explore observational and modeling tools fundamental to many CRIOS research projects.
