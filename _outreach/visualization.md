In collaboration with visualization specialist Greg Foss from the Visualization Lab of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin, An T. Nguyen and Patrick Heimbach produced the animated data visualization “Arctic Atlantification,“ which introduces CRIOS research in an intriguing manner. The animation is a sequence of graphic renderings of a computer simulation, which shows the water temperatures of the Arctic Ocean at a given time. The color of each pixel reﬂects a temperature value deﬁned in a legend. By putting the images into a time sequence, the evolution of temperatures over time becomes visible. 
Presented as a large video projection and accompanied by an accessible video-audio narrative produced by the CRIOS group, the visualization became the core element of the exhibition Exploring the Arctic Ocean on view at the Visual Arts Center from September through December 2018. “Arctic Atlantification” also won the “SC18 Scientific Visualization and Data Analytics Award” at the annual Supercomputing Conference in 2018.
