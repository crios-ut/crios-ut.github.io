Following the exhibition *Exploring the Arctic Ocean*, two of the participating artists, American conceptual artist Lize Mogel and German photographer Olaf Otto Becker loaned their works to the Oden Institute. Four photographs from Becker’s photographic series *Broken Line* and a map showing the Arctic Ocean, a center piece of Mogel’s multimedia installation *Area of Detail,* are on display on the 4th floor of the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Building. 

For his series *Broken Line*, Olaf Otto Becker photographed the landscape along the coastline of Greenland while traveling thousands of miles in a Zodiac raft. The slow pace of his journey and laborious process of producing his images with a large-format camera reverberate in Becker’s carefully composed photographs. The four photographs on view at the Oden Institute are a small selection from Broken Line that show distinct features of the Arctic Ocean and its shore. 

Lize Mogel is a counter-cartographer: As part of a collective effort working toward social change, Mogel uses cartographic conventions — including data, images, and language — to analyze and dissect power dynamics. In 2008, Mogel conceived *Area of Detail*, a project that scrutinizes the United Nations’ role as a regulatory body in the Arctic and examines the metaphorical meanings of its emblem, a world map as seen from its northernmost point.
